## What is the Schelling Segregation Model?

#### Schelling Segregation Model (SSM)

Schelling studied how macro (society wide) outcomes can diverge from micro (individual level) goals.

A key insight of Schelling is that we need hesitate before drawing conclusions about micro motives from the observation of a macro outcome.

#### Level to Level

Schelling offers an early model of “emergence” based on social/neighborhood interaction. Weak local preferences yield strong global phenomena.

This model introduces novel explanations at both the “micro to macro” level and the “macro to micro” level.

*   macro regularities emerge from micro level interactions.
*   macro regularities constrain individual agents and affect their behavior.

#### Social Context

Schelling intends his “self-forming neighborhood model” to shed light on racial segregation.

His work dates to a time when racial categories in the U.S. were cruder and where a primary concern was school and neighborhood segregation by race.

(Until 2000, census respondents in the US could choose only a single race.)

#### Efficiency

Schelling also draws attention to a “social efficiency” issue.

At the time he was writing, those with a taste for neighborhood diversity had extremely limited options.

>“The demographic map of almost any American metropolitan area suggests that it is easy to find residential areas that are all white or nearly so and areas that are all black or nearly so but hard to find localities in which neither whites nor nonwhites are more than, say, three-quarters of the total.” (p.141)
A Basic Segregation Model

#### Micro-level rules of the game

*   Stay if at least third of neighbors are the same kind
*   Move to random location otherwise

#### Macro-behavior of the game

*   Initial state: random distribution of agents
*   Final state: emergence of clusters
